lecture 01:
- how to solve problems with functions, variables, conditionals, loops
- how (not) to solve problems
- Source code --converter (compiler)--> Machine Code

visual studio on cloud:
- GUI (Graphical Line Interface), CLI (Command Line Interface)

C :
- line based
- code hello.c (filename.c) - to create the c file
- make hello (make filename) - to compile the file from source code to machine code
- ./hello - to get the output of the written code
- from scratch to c. how is the functions, arguments, side effects or outputs in c depending in what I learned on scratch
- escape sequences
> \n - end of line
(to print \n, put another \ like \\n)
> printf is living in the file called stdio.h
stdio.h will teach the compiler how print things to the screen.
- #inlcude tell the compiler to find the file called standardio.h and kinda copy paste it there, so the compiler know about printf and all the functions stored in stdio.h
- stdio.h is called a header file and it represents a library
- header file: file ending with .h
- library: a code that someone else wrote that I can use
ALL ABOUT LIBRARY - manual.cs50.io

- cs50.h library:
int → whole numbers
float → decimal numbers (less precision)
double → decimal numbers (more precision)
char → single character
long → bigger integer
string (char array) → text/word

- most used format specifier in c:
%d or %i - Integer (int)
%f - Float (decimal)
%lf - Double
%c - Character (char)
%ld - Long integer (long)
%s - String (char[])
