Cybersecurity
- Install Command line tool
- Learning git (version control software)
- Use main vs code app
- Host a website (GitHub or netify)
- Host a web app (pic on folder)

- passwords
- brute-force attacks
- password managers
- two factor authentication
- otp

- hashing (well designed website uses)
- password stuffing
- storing cryptic values instead of username and password on the database
- the server never saves the password but it does use the hash function to compare those same hash values again and again whenever the user logs in
- rainbow table (password - hash)

- salting: A random, unique value (salt) is generated for each user and combined with their password before hashing
- Duplicate passwords look unique in the database.
- Precomputed rainbow tables become useless

- cryptography
- symmetric cryptography (secret key)
- asymmetric cryptography (doesn't require that the user and the server uses the same secret key):
- aka public key cryptography
- Public key locks, private key unlocks (for encryption) — and the reverse for signatures
- HTTPS uses public key cryptography

- passkeys

- end-to-end encryption
Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device with the recipient’s public key

Servers just forward encrypted blobs, but it looks like gibberish to anyone in the middle

Only the recipient’s private key can decrypt it

- deletion
- secure deletion
- full-disk encryption

- ransomware
