>>Function Prototype (Previous class title)

- Cryptography
- Compiling: make hello (to run the c file) make is running an actual compiler for me.
clang hello.c
./a.out (if I type ./hello then it's not gonna work, clang default filename a.out)

- Command Line Argument
clang -o hello hello.c
(after typing this we can use ./hello)

- but when I use cs50 library then  need to change the command to this:
clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50 (//link cs5)

compiling is one of 4 steps in term of turning source code to machine code:

preprocessing: converts all of those #include lines to whatever the underlying prototypes are

compiling: converting c assembly language

assembling: assembly to machine code (that's why clang names is output as a.out [assembler output])

linking: 
when I run my .c file, I'm really combining 3 files: myfile.c    cs50.c    stdio.c
clang needs compile these 3 in zeros and ones separately, linking combines them.

- reverse engineering
- debugging:
debug50 (cs50's own debugger)

- garbage value: the value of a variable have before I ran it, according to the computer memory
- rubber duck debugging
- cs50.ai

- Memory:
bool - 1 bytes
int - 4 bytes
long - 8 bytes
float - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes
char - 1 byte
string - ? bytes (sequence of text, variable number of byte)

How computer is storing info using just these bytes.

- printf("Average: %f\n", (score1 + score2 +score3) / 3.0); here changed the denominator form 3 to 3.0 to get a float value. this is easier than casting

- Arrays: An array is just a collection of variables of the same type, stored next to each other in memory. back to back to back no gaps, left to right, top to bottom

- Global Variable: a variable that's not inside of curly braces and outside of main. Top of the file. a way of sharing a variable across functions. Usually a const variable.

- Strings: Sequence of characters. underneath array of characters. string's byte is n + 1, here the extra byte (\0 (8 zero bits) -called NUL) is to tell the computer where the strings ends.
H I ! \0

- Different Libraries from cs5 manual

- string.h (practiced strlen)
- ctype.h (toupper, tolower)

- command-line arguments: clang, cd, rm etc

int main(void) instead this:
int main(int argc, string argv[])

argc - argument count
argv - (an array of string) argument vertor (a list of values) - a list of command-line arguments.
the first word of argv is always the program name, the second word is whatever the human typed.

- ASCII art
- exist status

- echo $? - what's the recently run program secretly exit with?

- cryptography: ability send info securely
plaintext ->  [cipher]  -> ciphertext
key (number)

1. Caesar Cipher - each letter is shifted 3 places forward in the alphabet
2. ROT13 - each letter is shifted 13 places forward in the alphabet. (ROT26) - same letter

- decryption:
