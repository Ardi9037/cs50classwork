>>Function Prototype (Previous class title)

- Cryptography
- Compiling: make hello (to run the c file) make is running an actual compiler for me.
clang hello.c
./a.out (if I type ./hello then it's not gonna work, clang default filename a.out)

- Command Line Argument
clang -o hello hello.c
(after typing this we can use ./hello)

- but when I use cs50 library then  need to change the command to this:
clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50 (//link cs5)

compiling is one of 4 steps in term of turning source code to machine code:

preprocessing: converts all of those #include lines to whatever the underlying prototypes are

compiling: converting c assembly language

assembling: assembly to machine code (that's why clang names is output as a.out [assembler output])

linking: 
when I run my .c file, I'm really combining 3 files: myfile.c    cs50.c    stdio.c
clang needs compile these 3 in zeros and ones separately, linking combines them.

- reverse engineering
- debugging:
debug50 (cs50's own debugger)

- garbage value: the value of a variable have before I ran it, according to the computer memory
