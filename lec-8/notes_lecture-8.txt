HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- The Internet
- router: computers/servers, that routes information from left to bottom top to right, geographically, to get data from one point to another. many different sever between two points

- IP (Internet Protocol) #.#.#.# uniquely represents computers
- standardizes how the addresses work
- each numbers from 0 to 255
- ipv4 / ipv6
- computers/devices on the internet minimally provides a source address and a destination address

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- ip alone is not enough to guarantee delivery
- is the pair of protocols that the internet usages to get data from source to destination
- Ensures reliable delivery of data by having a sequence number (32 bits) and port number from the sender
- also help the server do more than one thing, helps them multiplex among email, web, video conferencing by using port numbers
- ports (port number) this program will open the sender's data for the receiver
- 80 HTTP
- 443 HTTPS
- 1.2.3.4:80 (destination address:port number, when making request on a web)

- DNS (Domain Name System Servers)
- everywhere 
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, so we don’t have to remember numbers
- You type www.google.com → DNS finds its IP address → your browser connects to Google’s server
- inside of a DNS server Doman name, IP address (also other different parts)
- Fully Qualified Doman name
google.com → not full (just a domain)

www.google.com. → FQDN (notice it includes everything: www = host, google = domain, .com = top-level domain, and even the hidden . at the end = root)

- my phone/laptop generally asks the local dns server which is owned by the internet service provider, if one server doesn't know then it's gonna ask someone bigger, recursively
- There are finite numbers of root servers in the world

- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- a service that automatically gives devices an IP address when they join a network

- HTTP ,rule for how web browsers and web servers talk to each other
- not secure (data is plain text)

- HTTPS, secure version (uses encryption with SSL/TLS, scrambled using very fancy mathematics)

- https://www.example.com/ the last '/' means default page for the webpage

- POST (sending info)
- GET (getting info)
(other website might be hosted on this server, this packet down is for the server to know what info do I want when I make a request)

GET / HTTP/2 (meaning the version of http)
Host: www.harvard,edu (http header) (key: value pairs here)
... (other http headers)

- this part down is what comes out of the server

HTTP/2 200 (status code)
Content-Type text/html (the type of content)
...

- curl (connect to url)

- inspect (developer tool)
- HTTP/2 301 → Redirect
Means, This page has permanently moved to a new address, go there instead.
- HTTP/2 404 (file not found)

- all most known status code pic saved in lec-8 file

- GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: safetyschool.org
...

- HTML (markup) (text based language)
- just about presenting info
mainly 2 concepts
- tags
- attributes (anything after the name of a tag, like: <html lang="eng"> here lang is an attribute, eng as values, key="value" pairs)
- <a href=""></a> anchor, hyper reference (needs website with protocol like http or https)
- video

- meta data:
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1", width=device-width">
(to make the web mobile or any device friendly)
- copy pasting this part is pretty common

- form tag
- https://www.example.com/path?key=value
- https://www.example.com/path?key=value&key=value (2 key value attached with ampersand)
- q = query (Google’s parameter for searches)

- regex (regular expression)
- special pattern used to search, match, or replace text
- this is not generally the best technique for validating user input and protecting against invalid user input
- coz client can't be trusted (the defense can be changed using inspect, developer tool)

. any single character (except line terminators)
* zero or more times
+ one or more times
? 0 or 1 time
{n} n occurrences
{n, m} at least n occurrences, at most m occurrences

- character classes:
[0123456789] any one of the enclosed characters
[0-9]        any one of the range of characters
\d           any digits
\D           any character that's not a digit

- validator.w3.org

- CSS (cascading style sheet) (key: value)
- properties (key: value pairs)
- selector (type, class, ID, attribute)
- html entity
- header, main, footer
- Bootstrap (a popular frame work or library)

- JavaScript (language)
- inside script tag
- #something this refers to id of a tag, same in css & JavaScript
- DOM (Document Object Model)
- DOMCOntentLoader: Run this JavaScript code once the HTML structure is ready to be used
- let variable_name (to create a variable)
- JavaScrept Events (javascript_event): events that webpages and mobile apps can listen for

- Geolocation (practice this from src github)
